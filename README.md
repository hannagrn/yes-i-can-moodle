# Yes, I can Moodle - Install and configure you own Moodle

## About

As a long time [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) user/fan/professional, I am ready to run my own Moodle. This project does not aim for a public Moodle, as I'm mostly learning LAMP stack further and just wanting to get to know my beloved LMS better.

In this repository I will document my learning journey and store any other interesting or necessary material.

Thank you,

Hanna Gr√∂ndahl (hannagrn)

Created the project repo. Started to set up the VM on VirtualBox. I'm going to run it on current Debian stable [Bookworm](https://www.debian.org/download).

- 4000 MB RAM
- 2 CPUs
- 40 GB hard drive

Powered the machine up and ran the installer.
